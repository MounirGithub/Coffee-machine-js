# Introduction

This mini project is used to learn Test Driven Development.

Of course, in your career, you have implemented more complicated stuff than a simple coffe machine that takes orders. But to make this mini project more interesting here are simple rules you must follow:

All production code is written to make a failing test pass
Do the simplest thing that could work for the current iteration

# Project
In this Coffe Machine Project, your task is to implement the logic (starting from a simple class) that translates orders from customers of the coffee machine to the drink maker. Your code will use the drink maker protocol to send commands to the drink maker.
